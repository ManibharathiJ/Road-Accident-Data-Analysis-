# Road Accident Analytics Dashboard 

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an insightful Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, providing comprehensive analytics to various stakeholders. The dashboard leverages extensive accident data, enabling users to identify trends, monitor key metrics (KPIs), and support data-driven decision-making for road safety and policy improvement.

## Features & Requirements

## Primary KPIs
•	Total Casualties: Number of casualties reported after accidents.
•	Accident Severity Analysis: Casualties and their percentage distribution by severity level (Slight, Serious, Fatal).
•	Vehicle Type Impact: Maximum casualties identified per vehicle type and the percentage contribution to total casualties.

## Secondary KPIs
•	Casualties by Vehicle Type: Break-down of total casualties reported for each vehicle type.

## Analytical Insights
1.	Monthly Trend Comparison: Visualization of total casualties for 2021 vs. 2022.
2.	Casualties by Road Type: Identification of road types with the highest casualties.
3.	Distribution by Road Surface: Analysis of accident distribution based on different road surfaces.
4.	Casualties by Area/Day/Night: Investigation into patterns relative to geographic area and time (day/night).

## Stakeholders
This dashboard is designed to address the needs of diverse stakeholders including:
1.	Ministry of Transport
2.	Road Transport Department
3.	Police Force
4.	Emergency Services Department
5.	Road Safety Corps
6.	Transport Operators
7.	Traffic Management Agencies
8.	Public
9.	Media


## Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository and ensure the .xlsx dataset (3M+ rows, 21 columns) is available.
2.	Set up dependencies— recommended stack: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly), Power BI, or Tableau.
3.	Data Processing: Clean, transform, and load the dataset focusing on 2021 and 2022.
   
## Build KPI Calculations:
•	Total casualties by severity, vehicle type, etc.
•	Monthly/yearly aggregations and compare trends.
•	Spatial/day-night breakdowns

## 	Visualization: 
Design dashboard pages for KPIs, trends, and distributions using the suggested BI tools.
## Documentation: 
Maintain code and dashboard documentation to ease maintenance and stakeholder onboarding.

This project empowers stakeholders with actionable insights into road safety—supporting better transport policies and safer roads.
